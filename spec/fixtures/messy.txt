ELIAKIM'S 



ADDRESS TO HIS READERS. 



55-5=1 



Charitable and Gentle Reader ! to thee 
the Author of this Book has little to say, thy 
attributes being the godlike virtues of meekness 
and charity. 

Pious and Religious Reader ! let not thy 
feelings be offended, and withhold thy censure, 
until thou shalt find in these pages a single sen- 
timent inconsistent with the spirit and prin- 
ciples of that holy religion which thou profess- 
est ; and condemn not the feebly imitative man- 
ner of writing therein occasionally employed, 
until thou canst point out a language more 
impressive, or more appropriate, than that in 
imitation whereof these chapters are framed. 

Readers in general ! take warning from 
the awful examples, and profit by the whole-

some admonitions therein contained, and be- 
lieve that they are truly intended for your good 
and welfare. 

Napoleon ! if, peradventure, this little vo- 
lume should ever reach thee, may its truths sink 
deep into thine heart, and remember in the midst 
of the torrents of blood thy guilty ambition is shed- 
ding, and the ruin and desolation it is spreading 
far and wide, that thou art a mortal man ; and 
one day, perhaps ere long, thy soul shall be 
required of thee, and an account of all thy deeds, 
by that omnipotent, unerring, and upright Be- 
ing, who, as he made and governeth, so in 
like manner shall he judge the world. 

King of the Albions ! of whom mention 
is made in these pages, be assured, that the ef- 
fusions of loyalty to thy person, and admiration 
of thy virtues, which they contain, are those not 
of the author only, but of a brave, affectionate, 
and dutiful people. 

ELIAKIM.
